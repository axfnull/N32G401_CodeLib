    ADTIM Configuration to:

    1/ Generate 3 complementary PWM signals with 3 different duty cycles:
    ADTIMCLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the ADTIM Prescaler is equal to 0 so the
    ADTIM counter clock used is SystemCoreClock.
    * SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz.

    The objective is to generate PWM signal at 72 KHz:
    - ADTIM_Period = (SystemCoreClock / 72000) - 1
    
    The Three Duty cycles are computed as the following description:

    The channel 1 duty cycle is set to 50% so channel 1N is set to 50%.
    The channel 2 duty cycle is set to 25% so channel 2N is set to 75%.
    The channel 3 duty cycle is set to 12.5% so channel 3N is set to 87.5%.
    The channel 4 duty cycle is set to 12.5% 
    The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
      - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (ADTIM_Period - 1) / 100

    2/ Insert a dead time equal to 11/SystemCoreClock ns
    3/ Configure the break feature, active at High level, and using the automatic
     output enable feature
    4/ Use the Locking parameters level1.
                                                                                */
