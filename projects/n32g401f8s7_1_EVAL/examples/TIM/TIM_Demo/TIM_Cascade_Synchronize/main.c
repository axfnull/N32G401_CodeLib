     1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output

     2/TIM3 is slave for TIM2 and Master for TIM4,
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
       are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 update event).
     - The TIM3 Update event is used as Trigger Output.

      3/TIM4 is slave for TIM3,
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The ITR2(TIM3) is used as input trigger
     - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
       are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM3 update event).

       The TIMxCLK is fixed to 36 MHz, the TIM2 counter clock is 36 MHz.

       The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency :
       TIM2 frequency = (TIM2 counter clock)/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 140 KHz
       and the duty cycle = TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

       The TIM3 is running:
       - At (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 35 KHz and a duty cycle
         equal to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 25%

        The TIM4 is running:
      - At (TIM3 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 8.75 KHz and a duty cycle
        equal to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 25%  **/
