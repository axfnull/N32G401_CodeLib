     1/TIM1 is configured as Master Timer:
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The TIM1 Update event is used as Trigger Output

     2/TIM3 and TIM4 are slaves for TIM1,
     - PWM Mode is used
     - The ITR0(TIM1) is used as input trigger for both slaves
     - Gated mode is used, so starts and stops of slaves counters
       are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(update event).

    The Master Timer TIM1 is running at:
    TIM1 frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (TIM1_Period + 1) = 250 KHz
